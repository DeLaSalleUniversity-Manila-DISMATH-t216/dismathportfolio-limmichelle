## WEEK 1:

- We introduced each other by telling our names, course, and favorite hobbies. 
- However, our professor discussed a brief introduction about Discrete Mathemiatics and ts advantage that made me interested because it will enhance my critical thinking.
- I have learned that there are different classifications of truth: authoritative, legal, scientific, probable, philosophical, and mathematical. 
- I have learned that the primary focus of Discrete Mathematics is "mathematical" truth.
- I learned the definition of logic which is the <i>basis of all mathematical reasoning, and of all automated reasoning</i> (Rosen, 2007).
- I learned about propositions, a declarative statement that is either true or false but not both, and its definitions - negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional, and biconditional. 
- I learned to use the truth table to prove logical statements. 
- I am introduced to new symbols for logic; ¬ (negation), ∧ (conjunction or "AND"), ∨ (disjunction or "OR"), ⊕ (exclusive or),  → (conditional or implication), and ↔ (biconditional). 
- In addition, we were introduced to the concepts of converse, inverse, and contrapositive. 
- Converse (p → q ≠ q → p), Inverse (¬p → ¬q), Contrapositive (¬q → ¬p).
- In short the table will help summarized it.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Formula | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p) | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q)) | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | or | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q)) | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | if, then | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0  | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0 |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

## WEEK 2:

- I learned that using truth table has its limitations and there is another way to prove logical statements by the use of logical equivalences.
- There are different logical equivalences:

  | Equivalence | Name |
  | :---------: | :--: |
  | p ∧ <b>T</b> ≡ p <p>p ∨ <b>F</b> ≡ p</p> | Identity Laws |
  | p ∨ <b>T</b> ≡ <b>T</b> <p>p ∧ <b>F</b> ≡ <b>F</b> | Domination Laws |
  | p ∨ p ≡ p <p>p ∧ p ≡ p | Idempotent Laws |
  | ¬(¬p) ≡ p | Double Negation Law |
  | p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p <p>p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p</p> | Commutative Laws |
  | (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ q ∨ (p ∨ r) <p>(p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ q ∧ (p ∧ r)</p> | Associative Laws |
  | p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (q ∨ r) <p> p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (q ∧ r)</p> | Distributive Laws |
  | ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q <p>¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q</p> | De Morgan's Law |
  | p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p <p>p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p</p> | Absorption Laws |
  | p ∨ ¬p ≡ <b>T</b> <p>p ∧ ¬p ≡ <b>F</b> | Negation Laws |

- After logical equivalances, we learned about Predicate Logic and Quantifiers.
- Predicate Logic deals with propositions that contains predicates, which refers to the <i>property of the subject or statement can have</i> (Rosen, 2007). 
- I learned that quantification is a process of producing a proposition from a propositional function. 
- We are introducted to two quantifiers: " <i><b>For all</i></b> " (∀) Universal Quantification & " <i><b>There exists</i></b> " (∃) Existential Quantification.
- We are given a homework to prove if Superman really exists by using the rule of inference.
- I learned that the rule of inference states that an argument is <b>valid</b> if it follows the pattern of the rules of inference.
- I also learned that <i>validity</i> and <i>truth</i> are two different things because an argument can be valid but not true. 
- The rules of inference are <b> Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Hypothetical Syllogism, Disjunctive Syllogism, Addition, Simplification, Conjunction, and Resolution </b>.

- <b> Note </b>
- A <i> if </i> B 
- where <p> A is <b> consequent </b> </p>  <p> B is <b> antecedent </b> </p>
-  A <i> only if </i> B 
- where <p> A is <b> antecedent </b> </p>  <p> B is <b> consequent </b> </p>
